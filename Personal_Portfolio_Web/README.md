# 🌐 LearnWeb – Rotana's First Web Project

Welcome to my personal website! This is my first web development project, built using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

I made this to practice what I’m learning and to have a place where I can share my work, interests, and contact info.

## 🔧 What I Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with light/dark mode support 🌙☀️)
- JavaScript (for theme toggle and interactivity)
- GitHub Pages (for free hosting)

---

## ✨ Features

- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- Toggle between light and dark mode
- Separate pages for:
  - 🏠 Home (`index.html`)
  - 📁 Projects (`projects.html`)
  - ✉️ Contact (`contact.html`)
- Clean, beginner-friendly code
