# 🌐 LearnWeb – Rotana's First Web Project

Welcome to my personal website! This is my first web development project, built using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

I made this to practice what I’m learning and to have a place where I can share my work, interests, and contact info.

## 🔧 What I Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with light/dark mode support 🌙☀️)
- JavaScript (for theme toggle and interactivity)
- GitHub Pages (for free hosting)
